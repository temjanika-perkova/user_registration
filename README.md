User Registration using Spring Boot, MongoDB and AngularJS (angular cli)


## command prompt for mongodb
In order to run the project, you need to install MongoDB and run it within this command:
- `mongod`
The mongodb instance will be running usually on the port 27017

## mongodb command-line
After starting the database, open the console `mongo` and execute the following commands:
- `use db_users`; => this will create the database db_users
- `db.createCollection("users")`; => this will create the collection `users` that will be used in this project

## IDE:
IntelliJ IDEA
Open the project usereg
Run the project inside usereg
## Spring Boot 
Running usually on the port 8080
The url of the Rest Api is: http://localhost:8080/users

## AngularJS
The root of the project is `api-client`

### Development server

Run `ng serve` inside the root directory `api-client` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` in the root directory `api-client` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
